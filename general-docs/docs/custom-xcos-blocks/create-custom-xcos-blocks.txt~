The Xcos SCIFUNC_BLOCK_M block, or the Scilab function block, is a nice little block that allows the user to create a custom Xcos block defined using scilab functions. What makes this block so useful is the block's flexibility. The user can essentially create a Scilab function script replete with logic statements, less common Scilab functions or whatever is necessary and not immediately realizable with Xcos, and place it into the block.

This block is located in the User Defined Functions palette.

Opening the block parameters of a SCIFUN_BLOCK_M will bring up 5 dialog boxes.
